          <p>Hello, just call me Anshu. I'm currently a Data Engineer at Shopify in Waterloo, Canada. In the past, I've held positions relating to data analysis and data warehouse development at BlackBerry, and done a fair bit of web development on a contractual/ad-hoc basis.</p>

          <p>My interests are very much centered around the work I currently do (in fact, sometimes it becomes difficult to distinguish the two). Specifically, I love programming in Python, and enjoy pushing <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a> onto those who haven't yet explored them for data analysis.</p>
