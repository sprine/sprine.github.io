    <h3>Staff Engineer @ People Analytics</h3>
    <kbd><b>Shopify</b>, Ottawa, Canada (Remote) – (September 2015 - Present)</kbd>

<p>The engineering role at this scope (Staff) changes rather frequently for me. Some patterns that stand out:
<ul>
  <li>prototyping and curiosity to explore new spaces continues to be the most important aspect. That's mainly how I learn. While most ideas remain sketches (in Excalidraw, Figma, Sketch, whiteboards or on paper) and abandoned code branches (an attempt, usually a script or data visualization of some sort, sometimes a Jupyter notebook), some threads do end up being useful and introduce a block that connects. These moments are rare, especially when working with driven and like-minded people, but can help significantly.
  <li>because of my area of work over the past years in People Analytics, I've learned the (current) shape and ideas behind some highly sensitive internal systems. Data flows everywhere, and wrangling it (and surrounding code) often feels more like molding a lump of clay than dealing with hard technology. It can also sometimes be similarly exhausting.
  <li>The breath of responsibilities, expectations, doubts and mental models evolve constantly. Having an understanding manager or lead who travels alongside never hurts.
</ul>
<b>I have also held the following roles at Shopify:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Senior Data Engineer, People Analytics. April 2019 - September 2022.
  <li>Senior Data Engineer, Data Apps. August 2017 - April 2019
  <li>Data Engineer, Shopify Plus. September 2015 - August 2017
</ul>

<h3>Data Analyst + Data Architect</h3>
<kbd><b>BlackBerry</b>, Waterloo, Canada – (May 2014 - Oct 2019)</kbd>
<ul>
  <li>Support, design and develop data pipelines for business critical applications and dashboards that impact decisions made within all departments of the Quality organization.
  <li>Perform ad-hoc data analysis and investigations, as well as debugging Oracle PL/SQL and SQL performance issues.
  <li>Responsible for developing and implementing a longer-term plan for migrating ETL processing from the current dimensionally-modelled Oracle database into a non-relational storage structure.
  <li>Provided Python, Elasticsearch and Git tutorials for members of the Analytics team. This allowed many SAS and SQL-intensive processes to be migrated to Python while retaining (or improving) the execution time and supportability.
  <li>Performed various experiments in order to research and evaluate solutions for building a data mining platform from scratch - the tests covered everything from designing easy user interfaces to the technical considerations. The findings had a direct impact on the design and implementation details of a cross-functional Six Sigma project, leading to significant cost savings and efficiencies.
</ul>
<b>I have also held the following roles at BlackBerry:</b>
<ul>
<li>Analyst, Voice of the Customer. August 2014 - December 2014.
  <li>Quality Manager, Enterprise. May 2014 - August 2014.
  <li>Database Application Analyst. September 2012 - May 2014.
  <li>Database Systems Developer. Jan 2011 - Sept 2012.
</ul>
